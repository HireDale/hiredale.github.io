## **DAY TO DAY RESPONSIBILITIES**
---
Creating and maintaining technical documentation for a client-facing product is an ongoing, sprint-driven cycle. Each iteration brings new content to add and existing material to revise, making the process a constant loop of research, writing, editing, and publishing—always with a growing list of updates for the next release.

My daily work includes:

- Producing customer-facing technical documents such as:
  + User manuals and instructional guides using Adobe RoboHelp, MadCap Flare, and Microsoft Word
  + Online help files and technical support articles in Atlassian Confluence, WordPress, and Ghost
  + Version update notes and archived release notes using Adobe FrameMaker, Microsoft Word, and Adobe Acrobat
  + Short, simplified, and targeted quick-reference guides in Microsoft Word
- Proofreading and editing existing documentation to align with established style and formatting standards.
- Updating materials in line with sprint changes, including:
  + Revising technical guides and procedures to reflect the latest product updates
  + Refreshing screenshots, field definitions, and button descriptions to match current UI designs
- Accessing pre-release builds to explore, verify, and document new or modified features directly.
- Researching and simplifying technical terms to create clear, detailed, and accessible instructions for the intended audience.
- Adjusting instructional depth and complexity to match varying levels of user familiarity.
- Creating tutorial videos and e-learning modules using Adobe Captivate.
- Designing and managing supplemental visuals, diagrams, and instructional graphics with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

## **COLLABORATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES**

From experience, technical writing is 50% documentation and 50% collaboration. 

Without constant communication and feedback from the Development Team, the current documentation is at risk of being out of date, inaccurate, or incomplete. And the last thing you need to hear after publication is a team member wanting last-minute changes to the already-published work. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the team informed during the entire technical writing process.

During the course of a standard sprint cycle, my team-centric tasks include:


- Monitoring the product’s developments and roadblocks via user stories and attached files in Atlassian Jira and other online support files. This ensures accurate and up-to-date sources for documentation.
- Collaborating with Designers, QAs, Developers, and Product Owners to gather information on documentation changes.
- Providing drafts for review to associated team members using Adobe Acrobat, OneDrive, and SharePoint.
- Gathering feedback with each user story’s assigned development team members on technical documentation drafts to:
  + Ensure clarity and accuracy of final documentation
  + Incorporate their insights to enhance team rapport and line of communication for future sprints and projects
- Acting as a liaison between Development Team members to resolve conflicts in feedback. This is to ensure that the changes have been approved by both the QAs and the Developers. 
- Attending meetings, presentations, and demos using MS Teams to discuss changes and progress in the user stories.
