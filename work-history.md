# **A HISTORY OF REMOTE WORK**
---

For more than a decade, I have delivered high‑impact technical documentation and visual content for teams across North America and Europe — all in fully remote, graveyard‑shift roles. This schedule has demanded exceptional self‑management, cross‑time‑zone collaboration, and consistent delivery under tight release timelines.

Remote work has strengthened my skills in time management and workload prioritization. At the start of each project or task cycle, I identify the highest‑priority work items and allocate sufficient time for research and writing on major deliverables, while ensuring that smaller updates receive thorough documentation.

It has also reinforced my ability to work independently without constant oversight, while maintaining the collaborative practices necessary to keep documentation accurate, consistent, and current.
