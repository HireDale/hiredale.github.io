## DAY-TO-DAY TASKS

Creating and managing technical documentation for a client-facing product can be very cyclical. 

There is always something new to add and there is always something to change with every new sprint. 

Over time, documentation becomes a constant loop of research, writing, editing, and publication – with an ever-growing list of tasks for the next product release. 

My day-to-day tasks included:

- Creating customer-facing technical documents such as:
•	User manuals and instructional guides for products using Adobe RoboHelp, Madcap Flare, and MS Word
  + Online help files and technical support documents using Atlassian Confluence, WordPress, and Ghost
  + Version update notes and archived release notes using Adobe FrameMaker, MS Word, and Adobe Acrobat
  +	Short, simplified, and targeted guides using MS Word
- Proofreading and editing existing technical documents to match design and formatting styles based on the company’s established guidelines.
- Updating the following based on changes made during the sprint:
  +	Existing technical guides and procedures to match the product’s latest updates and changes
  +	Existing screenshots and field/button definitions to match the product’s latest user interface changes
- Accessing the pre-release version of the application to directly view, research, play around, and document the changes.
- Researching and simplifying technical terms to make instructions clear, detailed, and accessible for the target audience.
- Adjusting the complexity in the technical instructions to match the target audience’s comprehension and familiarity level.
- Creating tutorial support clips and additional e-learning content using Adobe Captivate.
- Creating and managing supplemental visuals, art, and instructional graphics using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

## COLLABORATIVE TASKS

From experience, technical writing is 50% documentation and 50% collaboration. 

Without constant communication and feedback from the Development Team, the current documentation is at risk of being out of date, inaccurate, or incomplete. And the last thing you need to hear after publication is a team member wanting last-minute changes to the already-published work. 

Therefore, it is necessary to keep the team informed during the entire technical writing process.

During the course of a standard sprint cycle, my team-centric tasks include:

- Monitoring the product’s developments and roadblocks via user stories and attached files in Atlassian Jira and other online support files. This ensures accurate and up-to-date sources for documentation.
- Collaborating with Designers, QAs, Developers, and Product Owners to gather information on documentation changes.
- Providing drafts for review to associated team members using Adobe Acrobat, OneDrive, and SharePoint.
- Gathering feedback with each user story’s assigned development team members on technical documentation drafts to:
  + Ensure clarity and accuracy of final documentation
  +	Incorporate their insights to enhance team rapport and line of communication for future sprints and projects
- Acting as a liaison between Development Team members to resolve conflicts in feedback. This is to ensure that the changes have been approved by both the QAs and the Developers. 
- Attending meetings, presentations, and demos using MS Teams to discuss changes and progress in the user stories.

## WHY HIRE ME?

My main sales pitch highlights my specialization and years of experience in two areas: technical writing and graphic design.

Technical writing is essential to effectively teach readers about a given topic. A good technical writer can provide clear, well-researched, and concise guides that can help both new and experienced users with their current problems.  

Adding graphic design to the mix further enhances the learning material by offering visual aid, quick summaries, and infographics. Key visuals can help reinforce the necessary concepts, making them easier to understand and remember. This combination ensures a comprehensive and engaging learning experience for all types of learners, enhancing retention of the subject matter.

## A HISTORY OF REMOTE WORK

Over the years, I have collaborated remotely with global teams, companies, and individual clients. Here, I contributed to technical documentation, support documentation, digital content, and graphic assets tailored for international audiences.

A decade of remote work has honed my skills in time management and workload prioritization. I have learned to prioritize user stories and tasks at the start of every sprint to allocate enough time for research and writing on major projects, while also ensuring that smaller changes still receive thorough documentation. 

It has also strengthened my ability to work independently without constant supervision, while also still understanding the importance of continuous collaboration to ensure accurate and up-to-date documentation.
