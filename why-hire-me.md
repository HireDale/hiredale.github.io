# **WHY HIRE ME**
---
My main sales pitch highlights my specialization and years of experience in two areas: technical writing and graphic design.

Technical writing is essential to effectively teach readers about a given topic. A good technical writer can provide clear, well-researched, and concise guides that can help both new and experienced users with their current problems.  

Adding graphic design to the mix further enhances the learning material by offering visual aid, quick summaries, and infographics. Key visuals can help reinforce the necessary concepts, making them easier to understand and remember. This combination ensures a comprehensive and engaging learning experience for all types of learners, enhancing retention of the subject matter.

## A HISTORY OF REMOTE WORK
---

I have spent more than a decade working remotely with global teams, companies, and individual clients. My contributions include technical documentation, support content, digital assets, and graphics designed for international audiences.  

Remote work has strengthened my skills in time management and workload prioritization. At the start of each project or task cycle, I identify the highestâ€‘priority work items and allocate sufficient time for research and writing on major deliverables, while ensuring that smaller updates receive thorough documentation.  

It has also reinforced my ability to work independently without constant oversight, while maintaining the collaborative practices necessary to keep documentation accurate, consistent, and current.
