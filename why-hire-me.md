## **WHY HIRE ME**
---

My work is built on a simple principle: documentation should serve the reader, not the writer. I create end‑user documentation that meets people where they are — whether they are first‑time users or experienced professionals — and guide them to their goal without confusion or wasted time.

I approach every project by stepping into the reader’s perspective. I consider their technical background, their likely pain points, and the context in which they will use the material. This allows me to choose the right level of detail, the right structure, and the right language to make the instructions clear, relevant, and actionable.

Good documentation is more than a list of steps. It anticipates questions before they are asked, removes unnecessary complexity, and gives the user confidence in what they are doing. My goal is to ensure that the intended audience not only understands the instructions but can apply them successfully in real‑world situations.

## **A HISTORY OF REMOTE WORK**
---

For more than a decade, I have delivered high‑impact technical documentation and visual content for teams across North America, Europe, and the Middle East — all in fully remote, graveyard‑shift roles. This schedule has demanded exceptional self‑management, cross‑time‑zone collaboration, and consistent delivery under tight release timelines.

Remote work has strengthened my skills in time management and workload prioritization. At the start of each project or task cycle, I identify the highest‑priority work items and allocate sufficient time for research and writing on major deliverables, while ensuring that smaller updates receive thorough documentation.

It has also reinforced my ability to work independently without constant oversight, while maintaining the collaborative practices necessary to keep documentation accurate, consistent, and current.
