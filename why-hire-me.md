## **WHY HIRE ME**
---

The foundation of my technical writing can be summarized in one word: **empathy**. 

Documentation should be based on the reader's perspective, not the writer's. I specialize in creating end‑user content tailored specifically for the intended target audience.

I approach every project by looking at it from the user’s perspective. I consider their technical background, assess what terminologies would sound complex, and what instructions require additional information. I try to predict potential obstacles users will encounter, what paths they will take, and what they might look up in the documentation. This enables me to craft clear, relevant, and straight-to-the-point help topics. 

### **SPECIALIZATION IN HEALTHCARE**
---
My empathic approach to technical writing stems from my days in college. There, I spent my time working on my bachelor's degree in **Nursing**. While the field itself never appealed to me (I wanted to focus on writing, illustrations, and design), it nevertheless instilled values that I still use to this day.

As part of the curriculum, I created pamphlets, programs, and lectures about different healthcare topics. The audiences for these lectures were highly varied, including people of different ages, backgrounds, and health needs. Because of this wide range of audiences, I had to ensure that the materials I was making resonated with their specific recipients. Because each demographic has its own strengths, weaknesses, and attention spans, I had to make sure that the information in my lessons was retained by its audience.

My background in Nursing provided me with an insider’s look at how hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and health centers operate. This gives me a targeted perspective when writing for healthcare and medicine. I can approach topics from the patient-facing side, focusing on medication adherence and explaining conditions and treatments, as well as from the financial side, addressing insurance and other medical fees.
