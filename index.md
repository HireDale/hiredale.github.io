# **DOCUMENTATION THAT WORKS**
---
**The need to understand is universal.**

Without direct human assistance, help files and other support documents become the next best resource for understanding a product's functions and features, as well as finding solutions to problems encountered. Because of this, it is crucial to keep a product's technical documentation comprehensive, up to date, and easy to follow for both new and experienced users.

I have profound respect for the role technical documents play. They empower users to resolve issues independently, without needing to contact IT or customer support. Clear, up-to-date content saves everyone time and resources. In my view, help files and other support documents are like dictionaries. People already have a specific question in mind before opening them. Dictionaries may hold a labyrinth of information, but they are never read cover to cover for pleasure.

Therefore, technical writers must ensure that when customers _do_ open product documentation, they can quickly find the solution to their question. The answer must be readily available, easy to locate, and kept up to date with the current product. It must also be simple enough for beginners to follow while still providing the context needed to address more complex issues.
