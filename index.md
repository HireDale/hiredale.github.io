## WHY I WRITE
---
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The need to understand is universal.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Without direct human assistance, Help Files and other Support Documents become the next best resource for understanding a product's functions and features, as well as finding solutions to problems encountered. Therefore, it is crucial to keep a product's technical documentation comprehensive, up-to-date, and easy to follow for both new and experienced users alike.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I have profound respect and appreciation for the role technical documents play in providing essential assistance to their readers. They encourage users to develop better self-reliance for troubleshooting and enhance independent learning for product use. I also genuinely enjoy the cyclical nature of creating, editing, and maintaining documentation with each product update.
