# **DOCUMENTATION THAT WORKS**
---
**The need to understand is universal.**

Without direct human assistance, help files and other support documents become the next best resource for understanding a product's functions and features, as well as finding solutions to problems encountered. Therefore, it is crucial to keep a product's technical documentation comprehensive, up to date, and easy to follow for both new and experienced users.

I have profound respect for the role technical documents play in providing essential assistance. They encourage users to develop better self‑reliance for troubleshooting and enhance independent learning for product use. I also enjoy the cyclical nature of creating, editing, and maintaining documentation with each product update.
