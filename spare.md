# **EXTRAS**

The way I see it, help files and other support documents are like dictionaries. People already have a specific question in mind before opening them. Dictionaries, while holding a vast amount of information, are never read cover to cover for the sheer enjoyment of it.

Therefore, technical writers must ensure that when customers _do_ open the help files, they can quickly find the solution to their question. The answer must be readily available, easy to locate, and kept up to date with the current product. It must also be simple enough for beginners to follow, while still providing the context needed to address more complex issues.
